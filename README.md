# ERC20 Token Factory DApp
Welcome to the ERC20 Token Factory DApp. This decentralized application (DApp) provides a simple yet powerful interface for creating your own ERC20 tokens directly on the Ethereum blockchain. It's powered by a combination of modern technologies, including React for the user interface and Ethereum smart contracts for the backend logic.

# Key Features*
* ERC20 Token Creation:  The DApp allows users to easily create their own ERC20 tokens by providing the token name and symbol. It abstracts the complexity of smart contract interactions, providing a simple, intuitive interface.

* React UI: The user interface is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a seamless experience for users to interact with the blockchain.
